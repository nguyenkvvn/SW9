## Description
The SW9 pistol frame is based off of FMDA's SD9 pistol frames. The SW9, being older, lacks the enhanced sear housing with integrated rails that the revised SD9 has. This model addresses that deficiency by introducing a DIY rail spec to accomodate the legacy SW9 sear housing.

## Variants
- **SW9 OEM Magazine** - Model to accomodate original SW9 magazines
- **SW9 Glock Magazine** - Variant compatible with Glock 17 pattern magazines.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **Parts Kit** - Procure a parts kit of your preference.
- x1 **Glock Steel Spring** - this is for retaining the magazine release button
- x1 **Glock magazine button** - _optional_ This is only needed if you are printing the Glock magazine variant
- x1 **SD9/SW9 Front Rail Block** - Front rails for the frame
- x1 **SW9 Rear Rail Set** - Rear rails for the frame

## Printing Instructions

- Print with 100% infill, with four walls.
