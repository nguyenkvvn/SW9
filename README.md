## Description
The SW9 pistol frame is based off of FMDA's SD9 pistol frames. The SW9, being older, lacks the enhanced sear housing with integrated rails that the revised SD9 has. This model addresses that deficiency by introducing a DIY rail spec to accomodate the legacy SW9 sear housing.

## Variants
- **SW9 OEM Magazine** - Model to accomodate original SW9 magazines
- **SW9 Glock Magazine** - Variant compatible with Glock 17 pattern magazines.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **Parts Kit** - Procure a parts kit of your preference.
- x1 **Glock Steel Spring** - this is for retaining the magazine release button
- x1 **Glock magazine button** - _optional_ This is only needed if you are printing the Glock magazine variant
- x1 **SD9/SW9 Front Rail Block** - Front rails for the frame
- x1 **SW9 Rear Rail Set** - Rear rails for the frame

## Instructions
1. Print the frame upside-down, with 100% infill. Regular supports are recommended. Use your best settings.
2. Remove all supports.
3. Install the front rail block and pin it in.
4. Install the trigger assembly and rear sear housing.
5. Install the rear rails; pin in the rear rails through the sear housing.
6. Install the front locking block, along with the slide release lever.
7. Assemble the slide and frame together. Perform a function check.

*PROTIP*: If your trigger is "dead" after cocking, you will need to manually disengage the sear with a thin punch or screw driver coming into the rear of the frame where the slide and frame meet. Refer to the first FAQ question on how to "fit" your sear.


## FAQ
**Q**: My trigger is "dead" when I try to pull it. There is tension when I pull back indicating that the sear and striker is interfacing, but the striker ultimatey never slips.

> **A:** I've only seen this on some rear sear cages. You will need a rotary tool with a sanding bit to use on the sear housing. Begin by taking off a few thousandths of an inch at the top tip of the sear (NOT THE STRIKER) perpendicuar to the frame, re-assembling the slide, and trying your trigger again. Repeat this process until you have a successful strike.

**Q:** Why is it that my trigger isn't resetting? It's like it's binding or scraping on something.

> **A:** I found this happens when the sear and trigger bar are bone dry. Drop a dab of gun oil where the two parts interface in the sear housing, and try to get a reset again.
